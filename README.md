**Original author's note for the main repository: The project is abandoned so it's highly unlikely that I'll be doing further work on it. Also, mind that pull requests will be automatically rejected!**

# ToDo
- fix the existing bug with public strings, arrays and _TrimO_ function, and then update the _EXE bot_ code according to the main project
- finish wizard (with _X-CSRF-Token_ detection and _basic HTTP auth_)
- make status bar more active in the process
- update the walkthrough

# Feature suggestions
- **Don't rotate proxy** option (in _Proxy and thread settings_ dialog)
- independent commands:
  - **[dinp]** - delayed input, which (unlike _[inp]_) will show once it's reached to it in the process
  - **[(e)tstamp]** - timestamp of current time; e - EPOCH; with the feature of adding time to it, e.g: **[tstamp+10m]** (which would return timestamp of 10 minutes in the future)
- Regex parameter for concatenating/addition of all occurences
- **if()** command and grouped clauses
